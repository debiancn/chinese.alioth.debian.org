## List of translation and l10n works in Debian

We are listing some of the translation works currently active in Debian.
Please consider helping them.

This is not a comprehensive list, please consider adding new/missing projects here.

### Coordination

We use a dedicated maillist: [debian-l10n-chinese](https://lists.debian.org/debian-l10n-chinese/).

The common-topic [debian-chinese-gb](https://lists.debian.org/debian-chinese-gb/) is also
being used.

### Official Debian Website

One can find information about how to write/translate Debian official website
(debian.org) at: [https://www.debian.org/devel/website/](https://www.debian.org/devel/website/).

You are encouraged to find a Debian Developer as your sponsor or seek help from
debian-www team if you wish to push your changes onto the website and you
are not a Debian Developer.

For Chinese translation, you may find the chinese committer Anthony Wong to sponsor
your works. [Detailed information can be found in this email](https://lists.debian.org/debian-chinese-gb/2016/11/msg00011.html).

### Debian Wiki

Debian Wiki needs your help to translate it into Chinese.

Anyone can get involved easily. All you need to do is to register an account on Debian Wiki,
and then start translation for existing pages or creating new pages according to directions.
Please visit [Chinese Instructions of Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/zh_CN/DebianWiki)
for more information.

### DDTP (Debian Description Translation Project)

All packages descriptions are to be translated through DDTP.
You may find the package translation by typing `apt show [pkgname]`
in the terminal, through package management system or via
[https://packages.debian.org](https://packages.debian.org) website.

This project is heavily in need of human power. Please visit
[https://ddtp2.debian.net](https://ddtp2.debian.net) and help
us with the translation. You need to register an account to start
the translation.

### Debian Handbook

Translation of debian-handbook is recommended when compared with debian-reference since the latter one is pretty outdated.

Translation is under coordination of (DD) Emfox Zhou.
